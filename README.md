# Spatial synthesis analysis of Treeweb data

## Aim

The aim of the analysis is to compare the importance of tree composition, tree richness and fragmentation on multiple ecosystem functions. The idea is to use variance partitioning approaches following Gelman and Hill 2007 and also Ratcliffe 2017. Fragmentation effect is divided into isolation effect (quantified via a proximity index) and edge effects (quantified via edge length within 100m of the plot).

## Repo use

* The scripts to run the analysis and create the figures are in the script/ subfolder
