[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/204004922.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/204004922)

## Aim

Explore and try to find ways to optimize forest management in the face of trade-offs and synergies between multiple ecosystem functions and the diversity of multiple taxa.

## Note on reproducability

* Running the R script "scripts/tradeoffs_script.r" should: (i) run the model, (ii) produce the main figures from the submitted manuscript
* make sure that all needed package are installed, this code was run with:
  * R v3.6.1
  * brms v2.8.0
  * plyr v1.8.4
  * dplyr v0.8.3
  * ggplot2 v3.2.1
  * fmsb v0.6.3

other package versions may lead to deviation in results.
