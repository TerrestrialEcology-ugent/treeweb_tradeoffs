* Decomp: decomposition rates using the Tea-Bag Index in %
* Biomass: tree biomass in tons per hectare
* P.germ: rates of seedling germination in %
* Herbivory: rates of leaf herbivory in %
* Predation: rates of predation on dummy caterpillars in %
* Bird.smi: Bird biomass computed as scaled mass index in grams
* frass: caterpillar biomass in g per square meter
